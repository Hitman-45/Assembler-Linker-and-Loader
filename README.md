Assembler Linker and Loader for Computer System Design

# Project Overview

This project involves breaking down a problem into a logical flow, implementing it in Python, and then converting it to C++ for better performance and system-level execution. The process is divided into three main parts:

### Work Done As of 25th-Aug-2025.

## Part 1 – Flowchart Design (CS22B034 Lavkush)

- **Flowchart Diagram**: Designed a flowchart that represents the logical flow of the problem.
- **Sequential Breakdown**: Broke down the process into sequential steps:
  - Start
  - Input
  - Processing
  - Output
  - End
- **Control Flow**: Ensured that the flowchart captures control flow, decision-making, and iterations, if any.
- **Visual Representation**: Represented the problem visually to make the later coding steps clear and structured.

## Part 2 – Python Implementation (CS22B005 Shankhesh)

- **Python Translation**: Translated the flowchart logic into Python code.
- **Function Design**: Wrote functions to represent each step of the flowchart.
- **Input Handling**: Ensured proper handling of inputs, conditions, and outputs.
- **Validation**: Validated the Python implementation by testing it against example inputs.
- **Prototype**: The Python version served as a prototype implementation for the logic.

## Part 3 – Conversion to C++ (CS22B043 Preet)

- **Conversion to C++**: Converted the Python program into C++.
- **Standard I/O**: Used standard input/output (`cin` / `cout`) instead of Python I/O.
- **C++ Syntax**: Applied C++ syntax for loops, conditionals, and functions while maintaining identical logic.
- **Main Function**: Structured the program with `main()` and modularized functions to reflect the flowchart steps.
- **System-Level Performance**: This conversion made the solution faster and more suitable for system-level execution.
